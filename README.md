Snaps are applications packaged with all their dependencies to run on all popular Linux distributions from a single build. They update automatically and roll back gracefully. This repo is the application for the [snapcraft.io](https://snapcraft.io) website.

If you are interested in Snaps, Snapping and Snapcraft, there is an active [discourse forum](https://forum.snapcraft.io/) that we encourage developers to join.

The site is largely maintained by the [Web and Design team](https://ubuntu.com/blog/topics/design) at [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). It is a stateless website project based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and hosted on a [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) cluster.


## Bugs and issues

If you have found a bug on the site or have an idea for a new feature, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft.io/issues/new), or suggest a fix by [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). You can also find a link to create issues in the footer of every page of the site itself.

### Bugs in snaps and tools

If you have found a bug elsewhere in the snap world:

- For issues with an individual **snap** - you can run `snap info` and use the *contact information* to find where you can get help.
- In the **snapcraft tool** - that builds and publishes snaps, [file it here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft)
- In **Snapd**, the daemon that manages snaps on the client, [file it here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd)


## Local development

The simplest way to run the site locally is using [`dotrun`](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun):

```bash
dotrun
```

Once the server has started, you can visit `http://127.0.0.1:8004` in your browser. You stop the server using `<ctrl>+c`.

> If you're running dotrun on macOS or Windows, you will have to use a different command to launch dotrun with an additional argument in order to get JavaScript code working:
```bash
dotrun -p 5004:5004
```

For more detailed local development instructions, see [HACKING.md](HACKING.md).
