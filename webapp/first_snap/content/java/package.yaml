  Management
  description: |
    Freeplane is a free and open source software application that
    supports thinking, sharing information and getting things done
    at work, in school and at home. The core of the software is tools
    for mind mapping (also known as concept mapping or information
    mapping) and using mapped information.
explain:
  metadata:
    - text: The name must be unique in the Snap Store. Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens. They cannot be all numbers. They also cannot start or end with a hyphen.
    - code: |
        name: freeplane
    - warning: |
        <span class="p-notification__status">Snap names are globally unique.</span> You should change any instance of <code>freeplane</code> to <code>${name}</code> before continuing to avoid conflicting with the official freeplane snap.
    - text: |
        Versions carry no semantic meaning in snaps. Use text that best identifies that release, it won't be used to compare against the preceding or following one.
    - code: |
        version: '1.6.10'
    - text: The summary can not exceed 79 characters. You can use a pipe ‘|’ in the description key to declare a multi-line description.
    - code: |
        description: |
  security:
    - text: The next section describes the level of confinement applied to your app.
    - code: |
        confinement: devmode
    - text: Snaps are containerised to ensure more predictable application behaviour and greater security.
    - text: It’s best to start a snap with the confinement in warning mode, rather than strictly applied. This is indicated through the <code>devmode</code> keyword.
    - text: Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations, add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.
  parts:
    - text: |
        Parts define how to build your app. Parts can be anything: programs, libraries, or other assets needed to create and run your application. Parts can point to local directories, remote git repositories, or tarballs.
    - code: |
        parts:
          freeplane:
            after: [desktop-glib-only]
            plugin: gradle
            source: .
            build: |
              export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
              gradle release -x test -x createGitTag
            install: |
              unzip DIST/freeplane_bin-*.zip -d $SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL/
            build-packages:
              - unzip
              - openjdk-8-jdk
    - text: |
        The gradle plugin can build the application using standard parameters. However, in this case, we have overridden some gradle parameters (to disable testing, and prevent a new git tag being created), and set an appropriate JAVA_HOME in a build: script snippet.
    - text: |
        In the install: script snippet we’re unpacking the built application into a directory which later gets incorporated into the final snap, defined by the $SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL variable.
    - text: |
        The build requires an appropriate JDK/JRE and the install step requires the addition of the unzip command, so these are specified as build-packages.
  apps:
    - text: |
        Apps are the commands and services exposed to end users. If your command name matches the snap name, users will be able run the command directly.
    - code: |
          apps:
            freeplane:
                command: desktop-launch $SNAP/freeplane-1.6.10/freeplane.sh
    - warning: |
        <span class="p-notification__status"></span>As before, remember to change this instance of <code>freeplane</code> to <code>${name}</code> before continuing to avoid conflicting with the official freeplane snap.
    - text: The <code>command</code> specifies the path to the binary to be run. This is resolved relative to the root of your snap contents and automatically searches in the usr/sbin, usr/bin, sbin, and bin subdirectories of your snap.
