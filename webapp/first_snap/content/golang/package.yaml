explain:
  metadata:
    - text: The name must be unique in the Snap Store. Valid snap names consist of lower-case alphanumeric characters and hyphens. They cannot be all numbers. They also cannot start or end with a hyphen.
    - code: |
        name: httplab
    - warning: |
        <span class="p-notification__status">Snap names are globally unique.</span> You should change any instance of <code>httplab</code> to <code>test-httplab-{name}</code> (where <code>{name}</code> is your name) before continuing to avoid conflicting with the official httplab snap.
    - text: By specifying git for the version, the current git tag or commit will be used as the version string. Versions carry no semantic meaning in snaps.
    - code: |
        version: git
    - text: The summary can not exceed 79 characters. You can use a pipe ‘|’ in the description key to declare a multi-line description.
    - code: |
        description: |
  security:
    - text: The next section describes the level of confinement applied to your app.
    - code: |
        confinement: devmode
    - text: Snaps are containerised to ensure more predictable application behaviour and greater security.
    - text: It’s best to start a snap with the confinement in warning mode, rather than strictly applied. This is indicated through the <code>devmode</code> keyword.
    - text: Once an app is working well in devmode, you can review confinement violations, add appropriate interfaces, and switch to strict confinement.
  parts:
    - text: |
        Parts define what sources are needed to assemble your app. Parts can be anything: programs, libraries, or other needed assets.
    - code: |
        parts:
          httplab:
            plugin: go
            go-importpath: github.com/gchaincl/httplab
            source: .
            source-type: git
    - text: The Go plugin will build using the version of <a href="https://snapcraft.io/go">Go</a> present in the stable channel in the Snap Store. You can change this with the <code>go-channel</code> keyword (e.g. "1.8/stable").
    - text: The <code>source</code> keyword points to the root of your Go project and can be a local directory or remote Git repository.
    - text: When using local sources, snapcraft needs to construct a suitable <code>GOPATH</code>. For this it uses <code>go-importpath</code> to know where the sources should live within <code>GOPATH/src</code>
  apps:
    - text: Apps are the commands you want to expose to users and any background services your application provides.
    - code: |
        apps:
          test-httplab-{name}:
            command: bin/httplab
    - warning: |
        <span class="p-notification__status">Snap names are globally unique.</span> You should change any instance of <code>httplab</code> to <code>test-httplab-{name}</code> (where <code>{name}</code> is your name) before continuing to avoid conflicting with the official httplab snap.
    - text: The <code>command</code> specifies the path to the binary to be run. This is resolved relative to the root of your snap contents and automatically searches in the usr/sbin, usr/bin, sbin, and bin subdirectories of your snap.
    - text: If your command name matches the snap name, users will be able run the command directly.
