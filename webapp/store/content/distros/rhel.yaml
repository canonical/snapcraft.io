      Snap is available for <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/enterprise-linux-8" class="p-link--external">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8</a> and RHEL 7, from the 7.6 release onward.
  - action: |
      The packages for RHEL 8 and RHEL 7 are in each distribution’s respective <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL" class="p-link--external">Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux</a> (EPEL) repository. The instructions for adding this repository diverge slightly between RHEL 8 and RHEL 7, which is why they’re listed separately below.
  - action: |
      The EPEL repository can be added to <b>RHEL 8</b> with the following command:
    command: |
      sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
      sudo dnf upgrade
  - action: |
      The EPEL repository can be added to <b>RHEL 7</b> with the following command:
    command: |
      sudo rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  - action: |
      Adding the <i>optional</i> and <i>extras</i> repositories is also recommended:
    command: |
      sudo subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"
      sudo yum update
  - action: |
      Snap can now be installed as follows:
    command: |
      sudo yum install snapd
  - action: |
      Once installed, the <i>systemd</i> unit that manages the main snap communication socket needs to be enabled:
    command: |
      sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
  - action: |
      To enable <i>classic</i> snap support, enter the following to create a symbolic link between <code>/var/lib/snapd/snap</code> and <code>/snap</code>:
    command: |
      sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
  - action: |
      Either log out and back in again or restart your system to ensure snap’s paths are updated correctly.
