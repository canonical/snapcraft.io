install:
  -
    action: |
      Snap can be installed from the command line on openSUSE Leap 42.3, Leap 15 and Tumbleweed.
  -
    action: |
      You need first add the <em>snappy</em> repository from the terminal. Leap 15 users, for example, can do this with the following command:
    command: |
      sudo zypper addrepo --refresh https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/system:/snappy/openSUSE_Leap_15.0 snappy
  -
    action: |
      Swap out <code>openSUSE_Leap_15.0</code> for either <code>openSUSE_Leap_42.3</code> or <code>openSUSE_Tumbleweed</code> if you’re using a different version of openSUSE.
  -
    action: |
      With the repository added, import its GPG key:
    command: |
      sudo zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
  -
    action: |
      Finally, upgrade the package cache to include the new <em>snappy</em> repository:
    command: |
      sudo zypper dup --from snappy
  -
    action: |
      Snap can now be installed with the following:
    command: |
      sudo zypper install snapd
  -
    action: |
      You then need to either reboot, logout/login or <code>source /etc/profile</code> to have /snap/bin added to PATH.
      Additionally, enable and start both the <em>snapd</em> and the <em>snapd.apparmor</em> services with the following commands:
    command: |
      sudo systemctl enable snapd
      sudo systemctl start snapd
  -
    action: |
      Tumbleweed users also need to run the following:
    command: |
      sudo systemctl enable snapd.apparmor
      sudo systemctl start snapd.apparmor
