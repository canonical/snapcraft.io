If the developers are not able to maintain the snap for any reason, or not yet interested in maintaining the snap, we fill the gap.</li></ul><h2 class="p-heading--4">Who is part of it?</h2><p>Our formal community is split into three groups:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular members</strong> contribute to the snaps</li><li><strong>Core members</strong> are the leaders of the group and drive development and maintenance of the snaps</li><li><strong>Administrators</strong> are core members with full access to the account in the Snap Store and the GitHub repositories</li></ol><p>Visit <a class="p-link--external" href="https://github.com/snapcrafters">our website</a> to learn more about Snapcrafters and find out how you can get involved.</p>
